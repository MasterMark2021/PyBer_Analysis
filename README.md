PyBer Analysis

Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to create visualization  of PyBer's ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural) and to compare each of their performace. Business perspective also provided to address potential irregularities among city types.

Resources

Data Sources: Resources folder contain all the files and data used for this analysis.
Software: Python 3.8, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook

Results
There are only three categories of cities were used in this analysis: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. 



Urban Cities

The majority of PyBer's customers and drivers are located in Urban cities. As illustrated in the chart below, these areas account for 62.7% of the total fares. It is found that Urban cities have thirty times more drivers than Rural cities. However, due to the excess supply of drivers in Urban cities, the average fare per driver is only $16.57, which is the lowest of any market. This is the only city type where there are more total drivers than total rides. Refer to PieChart.png in the folder.


Suburban Cities

When compared to the Urban and Rural markets, the performance of Suburban cities is sustainable. The average Suburban fare is only $6.44 higher than in Urban cities, however the average driver fare is $22.93 higher than in Urban cities. There is a healthy balance of 490 drivers and 625 rides, which maintains a high average fare per driver. In all metrics analyzed, Suburban cities are consistently in second place.

Rural Cities

Rural cities on average have the least number of drivers and rides. Due to the low availablity of drivers, average fare prices in Rural areas are the highest of any city type at $34.62 per ride. Only 2.6% of PyBer's total drivers are located in Rural cities even though these areas account for 5.3% of Pyber's total rides. The low supply of Rural drivers has also increased the average fare per driver to be 40% higher than Suburban drivers and 235% higher than Urban drivers. 


Recommendations

In this analysis, Rural cities have higher fare prices and lower driver options than Urban and Suburban cities. Rural prices may be due to potential customers and deter new users from trying PyBer. More drivers are needed to service Rural cities to lower fare prices in these areas. Rural cities have a severe shortage of drivers when compared to Urban cities. Providing incentives for new drivers or creating job awareness campaigns in Rural cities may increase the number of drivers to solve this disparity.


However, adding more drivers to PyBer must be a balancing act. If there is an oversupply of drivers, such as the case in Urban cities, then the average driver fares will increase. Low average fares may result in drivers leaving PyBer's platform or joining competitors. Closing the service gap in Rural areas would increase PyBer's total ride count and it is a vital strategy going forward. Furthermore, it is critical to maintain high average driver fares, which will motivate drivers to stay on PyBer. To address the low average fares per driver in Urban areas, it is recommended to increase the total ride count with marketing solutions, such as user discounts and targeted advertisements to increase demand and brand awareness.
